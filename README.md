This week, functionality has been added to the application to connect to an API when performing login and user registration actions. This allows for better management of user data and more secure access to stored information. Also, a feature has been implemented to store user registration data in the device's localStorage, which facilitates access to this information and improves the user experience, since when the page is launched, the fields will be autocompleted with the data from the localStorage.

Also, the alerts were replaced by modal alerts, showing the correct information.

Regarding the display in the mobile version of the application, CSS has been used to set the "display" property to "none" for the side section, which means that this section will not be visible on mobile devices.
To make the side section visible on mobile devices, you need to make a change to the aside.css file located inside the css folder. You should look for line 9 where the "display" property is set to "none" for the side section and change it to "flex". This way, line 9 looks like this:

``` 
display: none;
```

It should therefore look like this:

```
display: flex;
```

By making this change, the side section will display correctly on mobile devices.
